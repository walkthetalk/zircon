  # **Note!** It's important that this library not depend on the
  # <lib/mmio/mmio.h> header at all, so it doesn't need to have
  # "$zx/system/dev/lib/mmio:headers" here.  The hwreg library can be used
  # with either the real mmio library ($zx/system/dev/lib/mmio) or with the
  # mock for testing ($zx/system/dev/lib/mock-mmio-reg).  The mock library
  # provides an alternate <lib/mmio/mmio.h> implementation.  If anything
  # that wants to use the mock library also winds up with the real library
  # in its deps (indirectly via public_deps in libraries like this) then
  # it's hard to make sure the library paths put the mock library first.
  # So it's better to simply avoid having the real library in the deps at
  # all.  But this means that this library's headers must be maintained so
  # that they can be used along with either <lib/mmio/mmio.h>
  # implementation without actually including *either* header at all.
