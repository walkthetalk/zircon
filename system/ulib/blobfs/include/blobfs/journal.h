// Journal which manages the in-memory journal (and background thread, which handles writing
// out entries to the on-disk journal, actual disk locations, and cleaning up old entries).
//
// With journaling enabled, the blobfs writeback flow is as follows:
//
// 1. Once a metadata WritebackWork containing a complete, atomic set of transactions is prepared
//    for writeback, it is enqueued to the Journal. If the WritebackWork contains only a sync
//    callback, then no preparation is done, but it is also sent to the JournalThread. Any entries
//    containing sync callbacks will go through the same queues as regular entries from here on
//    out, but nothing will be done with them until step 7.
//
// 2. The JournalThread will write the transaction data to its buffer, and send work to the
//    WritebackBuffer queue with transactions intended to write the journal entry out to disk.
//    However, the header and commit blocks will not yet be written out to the buffer, so the work
//    will block the writeback queue (not allowing any more writes to go through) until it is ready.
//
// 3. In the JournalThread, the entry whose work has been processed and sent to the
//    writeback queue will have its header and commit blocks written to the buffer, and will then
//    present its work as "ready" to the writeback queue.
//
// 4. Once a journal entry has been written out to disk, the journal will receive a callback to let
//    it know that the entry has been processed. At this point we know it is safe to write the data
//    out to its intended on-disk location.
//
// 5. Once the metadata has been written out to disk, the journal will receive another callback to
//    let it know that we can now "delete" the entry, and free up space for future entries in the
//    journal's buffer.
//
// 6. At this point the journal's info block is updated to reflect the index of the first entry and
//    current known length of all journal entries, the header/commit blocks of all fully processed
//    entries are erased, and any sync works are completed.
//
// 7. Now that all entries/metadata are up to date, we complete any sync requests that have made
//    their way through all the journaling queues.
//
// 8. The JournalThread will continue processing incoming entries until it receives the unmount
//    signal, at which point it will ensure that no entries are still waiting to be processed
//    before exiting.
