// This file specifies a pure virtual interface, `FilterBuilder`, of filter operations the parser
// may emit. This interface is intended to be reflective of the filter language the parser supports,
// rather than be tied to any particular filter implementation. Therefore it should evolve,
// for example becoming more abstract and/or flexible, as the filter language becomes more
// expressive. During parse, the client must pass a concrete implementation of `FilterBuilder` to
// the parser in order to construct filters.

// builder implementations to rearrange the data into the order required by filters. The internal
// state of a `FilterBuilder` is also allowed to change during a parse. The filter operation methods
// are therefore not marked `const`, and the correct way to pass a `FilterBuilder` is by pointer
// rather than `const` reference.
