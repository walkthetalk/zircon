// A FutexContext is the object which manages the state of all of the active
// futexes for a user-mode process.  Each ProcessDispatcher in the system will
// have a single FutexContext contained within it, and the objects should exist
// no-where else in the system.
//
// FutexContexts manage a pool of FutexContext::FutexStates which are
// contributed by threads created within the process.  This pool guarantees that
// threads are guaranteed to be able to allocate a FutexState object in O(1)
// time whenever they perform a FutexWait operation, as a Futex is only "active"
// when it has any waiters.  See (Grow|Shrink)FutexStatePool comments as well as
// the FutexState's notes (below) for more details.
//
// The remaining methods in the public interface implement the 3 primary futex
// syscall operations (Wait, Wake, and Requeue) as well as the one
// test/diagnostic operation (GetOwner).  See the zircon syscall documentation
// for further details.

    // Notes about FutexState lifecycle.
    // aka. Why is this safe?
    //
    // FutexState objects are used to track the state of any futex which
    // currently has waiters.  Currently, each thread in a process allocates one
    // FutexState and contributes its process' futex context's free pool.  When
    // the thread exits, it takes one context out of the free pool and lets it
    // expire.  A upper bound for the maximum number of active FutexStates in a
    // process is the current number of threads in the system, because to be
    // active, a FutexState needs to have at least one waiter.  So, by ensuring
    // that each thread contributes one FutexState to the process' pool, we can
    // be sure that we will always have at least one FutexState in the free pool
    // when it comes time for a thread to wait on a currently uncontested futex.
    //
    // FutexState objects are managed using ktl::unique_ptr.  At all times, a
    // FutexState will be in one of three states.
    //
    // 1) A member of a FutexContext's futex_table_.  Futexes in this state are
    //    currently active and have waiters.  Their futex ID will be non-zero.
    // 2) A member of a FutexContext's free_futexes_ list.  These futexes are
    //    not currently in use, but are available to be allocated and used.
    //    Their futex ID will be zero.
    // 3) A member of neither.  These futexes have been created, but not added
    //    to the pool yet, or removed from the free list by a thread which is
    //    exiting.  Their futex ID will be zero.
    //
    // During operation, FutexStates are borrowed from the active pool using
    // either |ObtainActiveFutex| or |ActivateFromPool| and held as a raw
    // FutexState*.  This is done under the protection of the FutexContex lock_,
    // and the life cycle of any FutexState* retrieved this way must never be
    // allowed to leave the scope in which lock_ is held as this reference has
    // only been borrowed, and it could become invalid as soon as the lock has
    // been released.
    //
    // TODO(johngro): Investigate more rigorous ways to enforce this borrow
    // pattern.  Introducing a move-only pointer wrapper object returned from
    // |ObtainActiveFutex| and |ActivateFromPool|, and given back during
    // |ReturnFromPool| could do the job if its constructor/destructor could be
    // made to TA_REQ the FutexContex::lock_, but unfortunately I know of no
    // good way to actually do this using the clang static analysis tools.
