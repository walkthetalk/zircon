        //    no waiters, but futex X's FutexState has not been returned to the
        //    pool yet.
        // 3) Before thread A makes it to the guard at the top of this block,
        //    Thread B comes along and attempts to wake at least one thread from
        //    futex X.
        // 4) Thread B is inside of the processes futex context lock when it
        //    does this, it notices that futex X's wait queue is now empty, so it
        //    returns the queue to the free pool.
        // 5) Finally, thread A makes it into the futex context lock and
        //    discovers that it had been waiting on futex X, but futex X is not in
        //    the set of active futexes.
        //
        // There are many other variations on this sequence, this just happens
        // to be the simplest one that I can think of.  Other threads can be
        // involved, futex X could have been retired, then reactivated any
        // number of times, and so on.
        //
        // The important things to realize here are...
        // 1) An truly active futex *must* have at least one waiter.
        // 2) Because of timeouts, it is possible for a futex to be in the
        //    active set, with no waiters.
        // 3) If #2 is true, then there must be at least one thread which has
        //    been released from the wait queue and it traveling along the error
        //    path.
        // 4) One of these threads will make it to here, enter the lock, and
        //    attempt to retire the FutexState to the inactive pool if it is
        //    still in the active set.
        // 5) It does not matter *who* does this, as long as someone does this
        //    job.  It can be the waking thread, or one of the timed out
        //    threads.  As long as everyone makes an attempt while inside of the
