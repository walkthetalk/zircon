# This file is provided by the toolchain to describe the runtime
# dependencies implied by linking a binary based on --target and other
# compiler switches.  The file contains a JSON array of objects that map to
# the following GN schema.  Each entry matches a single compilation mode
# and yields all the runtime dependencies implied by that mode.
#
# Type: list(scope)
#
#   target
#     Required: --target tuple a la ${toolchain.target_tuple}.
#     Type: string
#
#   cflags
#     Optional: List of compilation flags that select this mode,
#     e.g. "-fsanitizer=..." and the like.
#     Type: list(string)
#     Default: []
#
#   ldflags
#     Optional: Link-time flags that select this mode.
#     This is either [ "-static-libstdc++" ] or [].
#     Type: list(string)
#     Default: []
#
#   runtime
#     Required: List of runtime files needed by binaries in this mode.
#     Type: list(scope)
#
#       soname
#         Required: `DT_SONAME` string in the ELF shared library.
#         Type: string
#
#       dist
#         Required: File to load to satisfy $soname `DT_NEEDED` entries.
#         Type: path relative to JSON file's directory
#
#       debug
#         Optional: Unstripped or separate debug file matching $dist.
#         Type: path relative to JSON file's directory

# Every linking target, such as executable(), shared_library(), or
# loadable_module(), needs this in deps to represent the link-time and
# runtime dependencies of support code the compiler links in implicitly.
# The parameters indicate the compilation mode in terms of the link-time
# and compile-time flags used.  These must exactly match lists supplied by
# the toolchain in $clang_runtime to select for things like instrumentation
# and shared vs static linking of the standard C++ library.
#
# Parameters
#
#   cflags, ldflags
#     Required: Flags to match in the runtimes manifest.
